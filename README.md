# print-numbers
Using SOLID principles, write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Three". For multiples of 5 print "Five". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "ThreeAndFive". But here's the catch: you can use only one 'if'. No multiple branches, ternary operators or 'else'

# Requirements

 2. **Docker-compose** (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

# How to Run

 1. Clone or download the repository at https://github.com/leonofre/print-numbers
 2. Access the repository folder
 3. Run `docker-compose build`
 4. Run `docker-compose up` (the unit test results will be shown automatically after this command)
 5. Go to http://localhost:8000/ to see the printed numbers from 1 to 100, with the necessary changes
